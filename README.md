# Efficient Entity Clustering Package (subject to change)

## üñáÔ∏è Purpose

This package is designed to provide a base for Efficient Entity Clustering (EEC) application. It provides set of function and classes to build a the EEC application.

## üì¶ What is included

It includes the following abstract classes:

-   IEntityRepository: interface for entity repository
-   IClusterRepository: interface for cluster repository
-   IMentionClusteringMethod: interface for mention clustering method
-   IUserRepository: interface for user repository

following Data classes:

-   EntityModel: data class for entity
-   ClusterModel: data class for cluster
-   UserMentionModel: data class for user

and the following concrete classes:

-   BaseEntityRepository: base class for entity repository
-   BaseClusterRepository: base class for cluster repository
-   BaseMentionClusteringMethod: base class for mention clustering method
-   BaseUserRepository: base class for user repository

-   Neo4jEntityRepository: concrete class for entity repository
-   Neo4jClusterRepository: concrete class for cluster repository
-   Neo4jUserRepository: concrete class for user repository

Those concrete classes are able to provide a base for EEC application.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to install

On the root directory of the project, run the following command:

```bash
